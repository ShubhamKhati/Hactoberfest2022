"""
Write a function array_mult that takes two two-dimensional arrays and performs a matrix multiplication,
return a new two-dimensional array. Each array should be represented as a list of lists, i.e., as a list of rows,
as discussed earlier. For example,

>>> M1 = [[1, 2, 3], [-2, 3, 7]]
>>> M2 = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
>>> array_mult(M1, M2)
[[1, 2, 3], [-2, 3, 7]]

>>> M3 = [[1], [0], [-1]]
>>> array_mult(M1, M3)
[[-2], [-9]]
